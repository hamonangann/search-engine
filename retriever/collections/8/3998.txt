Ensuring supply = demand  A key issue ensuring the growth of slums is the demand for housing is failing to be met. Investment is required to supply housing.  Taking the case of Social Housing programs provided by PAHF (Pan-African Housing Fund) demand is being met by providing affordable houses. 41.5mn US$ has been confirmed by PAHF, of which will be dedicated to fulfil the need for houses. Investments are focusing on urban areas across Sub-Saharan Africa, and are operating through partnerships [1] . If slums are ever to be halted there need to be many more such projects ensuring the supply of houses outstrips demand.  [1] See further readings: PHATISA, 2013.

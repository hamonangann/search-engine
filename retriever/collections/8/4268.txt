Ethnic borders erase a wrong of history  Imperialism and Colonisation is one of the great wrongs of history where much of the globe was carved up without any reference to the facts on the ground. When the west drew borders peoples were split, and kingdoms and cultures carved up. Independence may have ended some of the worst aspects of imperialism but it exacerbated the problem of borders. [1] Africa has since seen the problems that this has created and should realise the need to break from the colonial legacy.  [1] Michalopoulos, 2011, p.4

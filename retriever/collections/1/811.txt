The only effect on US freedom of action would be prohibition of clear and significant violations of international law.  If the US stays within the international criminal law, they will not be affected by the ICC. It would be harmful for any state to have special treatment â€“ if the US were to be granted such special treatment to the United States other large states could request the same due to their self-perceived international roles. Such exceptions and opt outs would mean that the International Criminal Court would be granting impunity to large states, whatever gargantuan violations of the international law are committed, and only investigate smaller ones. This would clearly be an unfair system of international justice. If a country engages in more military engagements, and is larger and more powerful, it is all the more necessary that they are held to the same standards as smaller powers.

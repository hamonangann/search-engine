A free flow in goods is a desirable end in itself. The rational, efficient supply chain of grey imports reflects the ideal of the free market. Moving it from the shadows to a position of legitimacy would make it even more efficient, by reducing the effort currently employed to keep the imports' trail hidden, etc. There is also job creation involved in the distribution network. For example, the logistics and transportation activities involved in grey imports will create new work as the trade grows.

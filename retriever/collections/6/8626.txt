Mobile phones distracting  Mobile phones can easily distract us. They can be a particular problem in schools where they discourage us and those around us from working. Using a mobile phone while doing a piece of work will reduce your concentration making it more likely you will make mistakes.

Most young people spend well over an hour on their mobiles. As a result there is much less time for other activities.

The electoral college violates the democratic principle of equality in voting  Under the electoral college, all votes do not count equally. Voters in some states have more say in selecting the president than voters in other states.  For example, California has 55 electoral college votes, while Delaware only get 3 votes. There is not equality in that, every state should be equal, California for voting purposes is no more important that Delaware. [1]  [1] Electoral Map. Wikipedia. [Online] Available at:

Possessing greater wealth does not obligate an individual to contribute more to the state by any moral precept. All peopleâ€™s property rights should be protected equally. Citizens who succeed by their own industry and accrue wealth should not be punished for their success, or be expected to contribute more to a state that provided the same basic framework of law and rights to all citizens, rich and poor.

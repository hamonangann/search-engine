Unification would reignite civil disorder and violent factionalism among Irish communities  As shown above, the Northern Irish donâ€™t want to unite with the Republic. The Irish in the Republic will also resent the new drain on their economy.

The recent reoccurrence of violence in Belfast is being attributed to the breakdown of protestant communities and low job prospects for young protestants. Both of these problems will be exacerbated in a majority Catholic Ireland. All of these examples illustrate how unrest is likely to breakout again in a united Ireland.

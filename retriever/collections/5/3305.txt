Restrictions would prevent the poaching of the best youngsters from poor nations  This plan would be good for world football. At present poorer nations (e.g. in Africa or South America), or those where football isnâ€™t as well developed (e.g. Australia, the USA), lose all their best players at an early age to the rich European leagues. This weakens their own leagues and can lead to the public losing interest in football. Poor quality games and loss of public support for domestic clubs also means little money comes into the game from ticket sales, television or sponsorship, so nothing goes into grounds, training or youth systems. It is also hard to put a good national side together when the best players hardly ever spend any time in their own country.

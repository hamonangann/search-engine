Renting holds fewer benefits for women than ownership. For empowerment more women need to become home, and landowners. The provision of land titles to women means they have a sense of stability.

Equality in land titling will ensure women are able to save and seek safer livelihood options.  [1] See further readings: Action Aid, 2012.

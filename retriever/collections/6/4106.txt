NAFTA has improved democracy in Mexico.  Trade liberalization has caused social upheaval that created greater demand for genuine democracy within Mexico1. The election of 1994 is considered to be the first free election in the modern history of Mexico2. In 2000, the first opposition president (not a member of the Institutional Revolution Party) since 1929 was elected3. Many scholars credit the liberalized economic environment fostered by NAFTA for this political development towards a genuine democracy4.  1Kevin Kelley, "Good NAFTA?," Utne: The Best of the Alternative Press, 2011, 2.  2Renee G.

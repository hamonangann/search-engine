If there is really no freedom then these migrants will be asylum seekers and refugees not true intellectual migrants by choice.  Even if there is some alienation from their own native culture these migrants are still travelling to a much more alien culture. This being the case it seems unlikely that alienation is the main cause. Rather they are travelling to a culture that is more alien because they believe there are better opportunities there.

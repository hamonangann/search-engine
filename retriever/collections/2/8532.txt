Heavy scrutiny forces politicians to dedicate themselves fully to their public service  When politicians see themselves constantly under the lens of public scrutiny, they are essentially forced to dedicate themselves wholesale to their duties as representatives. They are disincentivized in the extreme to pursue any transgressive or hypocritical activities behind closed doors, resulting in more energy dedicated to legislating, and less to lining their pockets or chasing interns, since the added risk of being discovered increases the cost of trying to conceal their foibles.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s lurid sex life has thrown light on the sexual misconduct rife in French politics and has actually sparked a major effort to reform the system and a change to a more demanding culture towards politicians.

A powerful probe into politicians’ private lives can only serve the cause of better governance.  [1] Hughs, J. “Does the Public Really Have the Right to Know About Politicians’ Private Lives”.

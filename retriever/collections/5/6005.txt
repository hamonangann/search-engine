The reason why the death penalty is so expensive – 13 executions since 1978 in California costing around $4bn [1] - is the “super due process” that is necessary in capital cases, especially with the large flaws in the US justice system.  Blacker makes no coherent proposal on how he would modify the appeals system. Removing or reducing it would make it very likely that more innocent people would be executed.  To accuse people who want to prevent criminals deaths of wasting money is more or less victim blaming.  [1] Alarcon, Arthur and Mitchell, Paula, “Executing the will of the voters?

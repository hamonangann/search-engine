Challenges in tennis and cricket are limited to three per side â€“ here the number of challenges are potentially unlimited and GLT could be invoked whenever a team senses the possibility of gaining an advantage. Without limitations, the game could be endlessly stopped while officials turn to technology to confirm their decisions.  Football is a continuous game, with a natural ebb and flow, which the interruptions caused by GLT would disrupt.

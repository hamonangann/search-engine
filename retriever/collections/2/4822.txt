Joining Europe is unrealistic  A move towards the European sphere of influence might seem logical, but success is not guaranteed. In terms of population, Cape Verde would be the second smallest EU member state after Malta meaning it would have little influence over the Union when it joins. And there is little reason for the EU to desire Cape Verde’s membership as it will provide no real gains to the Union.  Also, its human development index is lower than that of Iraq [1] , over fifty places behind that of lowest EU member state Bulgaria – which when it comes to governance and development is subject to little more than ridicule in the media of other member states. Not every European nation would get in on economic criteria – Moldova joining is not likely in the near future either.  The only success from orientating towards Europe would be a burning of continental bridges with Africa.  [1] Central Intelligence Agency, ‘Iraq’, The World Factbook, 11 April 2014,

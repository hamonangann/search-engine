Additional crimes in the remit of an African Criminal Court could cause more problems than they solve.  Drug trafficking was rejected from the remit of the ICC [1] because it would overburden the court, which is intended to deal with international crimes. While the idea of prosecuting coups sounds good, in practice it would raise the same persecution complexes amongst leaders as the ICC does.  An AU court will also be subject to more local fractious politics and power struggles, rather than the bulk of the membership being from outside the region.

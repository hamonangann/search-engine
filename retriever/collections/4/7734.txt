A state has a fundamental right to set immigration policies and take the necessary steps to make them work.  Ironically, even Mexico recognizes this when it attempts to increase border enforcement along its own southern border with Guatemala1,2. If those policies are lawfully set by the people and legislature, then regardless of how efficacious a particular tool is, it is justified. It is clear that the fence is wildly popular – well over half of the United States supports it3 , and many individuals are so adamant about increasing border security that they are willing to make donations for these purposes4. The social contract of the United States means that the government is democratically elected and therefore accountable to its people. If they want to focus on securing the borders instead of providing more extensive welfare programs or reforming education or anything else they could be spending money on, that is their prerogative.  1Thompson, Ginger. “Mexico Worries About Its Own Southern Border.”  2Cutler, Michael. “Hypocrisy: Mexico Building Security Fence Against Guatemala.”  3Rasmussen Reports. “Support for Mexican Border Fence Up to 68%.”  4Crawford, Amanda. “Arizona’s State-Owned Mexico Border Fence Attracts Donors From Across U.S.”

Libertarianism is really a coalition of the unwilling; the fringes of the left and right, happy to criticize but without a single policy on which they can agree  The alliance supporting libertarianism is an interesting one, consisting mostly of right-wing pragmatists who donâ€™t want to pay taxes and left wing idealist who think that everyone would be kind and helpful in a free society.  What both groups simply ignore is that there are many issues, such as the redistribution of income or prohibition of drugs, where there is a settled will of society that supports the status quo. Even the very presence of, for example, wide-spread drug use would be an offence to very large numbers of people and unfairly impinge upon their lives which is why so few people actually vote for libertarian parties once they find out the realities.

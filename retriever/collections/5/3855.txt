Some Olympic events are held outside the main city. The football tournament uses venues across other cities (in the London 2012 games, Coventry, Cardiff and Manchester were amongst the cities hosting matches), and, being landlocked, Johannesburg would have to host the sailing at another venue. Sailing being held in another city is not unusual, in 2012 the sailing was held in Weymouth and in 2008 in Qingdao.  Training camps are typically held across the whole nation, too.  The national morale boost typically permeates far wider than just the host city, including the impact in favour of a more sporting culture in the country.

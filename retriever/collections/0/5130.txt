Working through many languages in the European Union costs money that could be spent on EU’s projects rather than unnecessary conversation.  It is very expensive to employ translators and interpreters, and to publish all documents in French as well as English. Ireland Business News reported that the EU’s translation (excluding interpreting) costs were 800 million Euros in 2006. This money is better spent on the EU’s actual practices.

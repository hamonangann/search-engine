Graduates may move abroad to avoid tax payments  As taxes are collected nationally there is no reason why a UK graduate could not simply upon graduating leave the country and avoid paying the education tax.

The proposed system then is simply not a practical one seeing as this massive and clear to see loophole exists with it.

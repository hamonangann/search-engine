Bullfighting has existed for thousands of years in the cultures it is practiced in, and yet these cultures have not become inherently barbaric or bloodthirsty, so arguments that say bullfighting has such effects on people are simply incorrect. What is at stake is not just 'entertainment' but rather something that many in these bullfighting countries perceive as being an art form intrinsic to their culture. Madrid has recognized and protected bullfighting not as a sport but as an art form.(1)  Bullfighting supporters in Europe have even campaigned for UNESCO World Heritage status for bullfighting.(14)  This cultural value makes bullfighting particularly significant and justifies any suffering the bull may endure.

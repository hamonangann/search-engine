Tackling hazardous environments  Reports are frequently raised on fire outbreaks and hazards in slums. For example, a fire in Khayelitsha township [1] , Cape Town, resulted in five deaths and significant damage. The use of highly flammable materials, in a desire for fast construction, places slum-dwellers prone to risk.  National investment in housing, by providing materials, such as bricks, or training on how to build stable house designs, will ensure safety. Haphazard building can be controlled by investing in housing designs and inspections.  [1] See further readings: Lobel, 2013.

Resources still flow out of the country  There is considerable evidence of a continuation of criminality linked to exploitation, including fraud, smuggling, counterfeit money, extortion, and tax evasion. Many natural riches are flown directly out of the country without being taxed – or worse being taxed by rebel groups. FRPI for example collects a tax of 3-5g per week from mines within their control. It is estimated by the UN that $383-409million worth of gold was smuggled out of the country in 2013. [1]  Reports indicate that criminal networks with political links transport and sell ‘unofficial’ quantities of minerals and other forms of wealth – such as ivory as a result of poaching, in return for arms. Child and slave labour is still being used – it has been estimated that in small mines up to 40% of the miners are children.

This ban constitutes serious governmental intrusion into parental responsibilities and private choices.  Parents, not politicians, should be responsible for guiding the choices their children make and the food they eat, especially when they pay for it with their own money. Parents may have other reasons for wanting their children to have the meal with a toy, for example the toy is a useful distraction for the child. Governments should not try to impose their own idea of what constitutes appropriate food choices for children on parents and on businesses. Governments may aim to promote and educate, but imposing bans on private businesses goes too far [1] .  [1] Martinez, Michael. “Mayor vetoes San Francisco ban on Happy Meals with toys.” CNN.

Medically there is no difference between generic and patented drugs. They are both identical, with the exception of aesthetic differences in some US drugs to avoid copyright infringement. Generic drugs cost less because they do not have to invest in R&amp;D [1] . They focus on efficient methods of production and ensure that their product can be sold at a competitively low price. The lack of a need for R&amp;D is therefore more prominent than quality in the pricing of generic drugs.  [1] Stoppler,M. ‘Generic Drugs, Are They as Good as Brand Names?’

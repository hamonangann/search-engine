The idea that the existence of marriage undermines other methods of raising children is ridiculous. This is equivalent to saying that making it legal for same-sex couples to adopt undermines raising children as a heterosexual couple or as a single parent.  Some people choosing to raise children in a certain way does not prevent or inhibit other people doing so in a different way.

The United States is not an appropriate agent for monitoring international security because it is only representative of one nation.  The U.S. is an independent nation, not an international entity. Thus 96% of the world population has no voice in its’ government’s decisions. [1] The US government has authority over its own citizens, and it is justified in engaging in war if its citizens are under direct threat. However, citizens of other nations have no means of expressing their opinion in the US government. If the US government abuses its power, these people have no reliable legal means of recourse. Consequently, the US government has no authority to intervene in their affairs.  [1] “Country Comparison: Population,” The World Fact Book, Central Intelligence Agency.

Most developed nations are representative democracies, in which we elect people to represent us and make decisions on our behalf. We retain the ultimate control over these representatives at the ballot box, and if we disagree with the decisions they have made we can vote for different candidates at the next election. Just because we can consult the public more easily nowadays, that is no reason to destroy a system that has generally served us well for decades and, in some cases, centuries.  Furthermore, electronic voting is still in its infancy, and liable to fraud and technical problems. [1]  [1] ”E-Voting Rights”, Electronic Frontier Foundation.

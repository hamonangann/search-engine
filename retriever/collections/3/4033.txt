Obama has delivered some remarkable reforms in fantastically difficult circumstances  On matters as diverse as healthcare to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Obama has pulled a whole series of rabbits out of the apparently impossible hat he inherited from Bush.  Among other surprises he took the lead in a G20 summit that produced $1.1tn to act as a bailout fund. He’s effectively resolved the catastrophes in two major conflict zones. He’s ensured that poor families actually stay in their homes. Increased funding for student loans, extended unemployment insurance at a time when 7,000 Americans a week were losing their benefits and, on top of all that he’s introduced a healthcare package that will give security and peace of mind to millions of Americans.  All of this has been accomplished in the face of extraordinary difficulties that were not of his making [i] .  [i] Athleen Rosell. "Devil's Advocate: Re-Elect Obama." The Daily Titan.

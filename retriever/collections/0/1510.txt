Needle exchanges can result in areas of open drug use around the needle exchange. Given the level of criminality of drug users it often causes these areas to degenerate into dangerous places which the public cannot go to.  This is effect causes harm to local business, not only because of the actual potential for harm, but also because people inherently fear drug dealers and addicts.  As well as this, the area around the needle exchange will have large numbers of stray needles, often causing as much damage as they prevent in other areas.4  1. Toni Meyer.

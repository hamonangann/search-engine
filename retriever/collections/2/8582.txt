Compelling employers to close for a day is the only way to ensure that marginalised groups are not forced to work a seven day week  Unions consistently argue that vulnerable workers – migrants, part-time workers, the young and other groups – are simply unable to choose their leisure time at their own preference. It is unlikely that all members of a family all of whom are in such employment would be likely to have leisure time to share.  It is simply a democratic principle that the right to an active family life and access to shared leisure should not be the preserve of the wealthy.  This divide can only be met by enforcing a day shared by all members of society.

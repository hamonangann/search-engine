The electoral college violates the democratic principle that the winner should be the candidate receiving the most votes.  In 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and probably 1960, the candidate receiving the most votes for president lost the election [1] .  This occurs because all but two states award all their electoral votes to the candidate winning a plurality in the state; because all states receive two electoral votes corresponding to their two US senators; because the number of House seats (which serve as the basis of the remaining electoral votes) often poorly match the population of the state; because states cast electoral votes no matter how many people actually vote; and because the size of the House is arbitrary.

Regional court is “best of both worlds”  A regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the African states and the International Criminal Court.  It would be able to provide an African solution to African problems, with no accusations of external interference or colonialism. Similarly, it would have some of the advantages of the ICC particularly its independence from individual states, meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account. With this accountability to an African court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders.

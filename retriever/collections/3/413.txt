There is no requirement within Christianity that the cross should be worn. This makes it quite different from other items of religious clothing â€“ specifically required as articles of faith - that are accepted in the workplace. It is an entirely reasonable distinction to draw a line between iconography that the employee believes it would be a sin to go without and that which is an active choice.

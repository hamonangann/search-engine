Every other indicator is also skewed in favour of high-income students. They tend to have parents who are better educated and are interested and much more involved in their childrenâ€™s education, as well as greater access relevant materials such as books and computers. Tutoring academically, while it may not involve having tutors test for a student, is probably much more impactful in the long-run, they may not be able to do extra-curricular activities but can help with homework (as can engaged parents), so would be just as likely to have an impact on coursework or another method of assessment as it does on the SATs.

These examples do not really demonstrate that food labels do not work or are deceptive but rather that consumers should be educated better about how to actually read and recognize them – something the consumers themselves want, a fact known now for decades. [1]  On the other hand, stricter regulations on packaging advertising are being called for as well, attacking the problem from another perspective.

In addition, this just goes to show that food labels are anything but ineffective – they just need to be known and regulated better.  [1] Hackleman, E.

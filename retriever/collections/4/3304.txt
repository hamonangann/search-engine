It will encourage fans to support their local clubs  A focus on domestic football and domestic footballers would encourage the public to get around their local sides. Therefore, this plan would be fruitful for club football and its relationship with the local community. Once the local team was a real source of local identity, with many home-grown players proud to wear the shirt of the club they grew up with.

How can fans identify with a club full of overseas players who will be gone in a season or two, and who otherwise neglect to support local youth talent?

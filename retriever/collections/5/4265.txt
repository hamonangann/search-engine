Ethnic borders allow nation states  In Africa borders are artificial often running through ethnic groupings without consideration for culture or even local geography with the exception of water courses. [1] Altering these borders to reflect ethnicities and culture would help states to create their own national identity as their identities would not be split. Having the whole of an ethnicity within one state will help prevent misappropriation of culture and history by another state.  [1] Michalopoulos, 2011, p.19

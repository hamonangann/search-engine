The potential for growth within other sectors of Tunisia’s economy is far greater than that of tourism, if invested in properly. The energy sector has been highlighted as a potential avenue for development, as energy efficiency projects would provide employment and a lower cost of production in the industrial sector1. At present, the industrial sector’s low profits are the product of high-energy costs due to energy imports. Sustainable energy production in Tunisia through projects such as solar panels would help increase profit margins.  Research and development in industry and agriculture also has the potential to increase profits and employment. At present there are few private R&amp;D departments in comparison to those in the public sector, but it provides another avenue for greater technical efficiency in other areas which could then create a higher revenue2.  1) World Bank, ‘Energy Efficiency in Tunisia: Promoting Industry While Protecting the Environment’, 23 May 2013  2) Aoun,A. ‘The Performance of Tunisian Agriculture: An Economic Appraisal’ pg.7

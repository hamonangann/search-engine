The improvement of cluster bombs in the way that opposition describes has not happened yet and these bombs have not been deployed. It would be fairly easy to class these new cluster bombs differently to older models should they come into effect.

A ban on cluster bombs could easily exist to simply encompass older models whilst leaving newer ones alone.11

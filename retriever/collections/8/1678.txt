While there will of course be people who do not try to get the most out of their university educations, what matters is that everyone has access to it. It is a fair trade between inefficiencies created by inattentive students and diligent students who would have lacked the facility to attend without it being free. More degreeÂ­holders thus do not automatically diminish the value of having degrees; they make the grades gained and degree subject more important.

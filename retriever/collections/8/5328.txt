A screening culture may lead to the value of human life becoming distorted  Genetic engineering treats embryos like commodities: “if the product isn’t sufficiently equipped, doesn’t produce the desired results – we will not launch it”. Even if we weren't considering embryos to be "human life", it is inappropriate to treat them as commodities with an "option to purchase". This cheapens at least the potential life-forms these embryos can become.  Views of doctors and also future parents regarding the value of their unborn children’s lives are changing.  In a survey taken in New England (USA), there was a substantial majority in favor of genetic screening for a wide range of disorders. About 11 per cent of the couples have also admitted to wanting to abort a child that was genetically predisposed to obesity. A condition with which it is possible to live a good lifestyle (1).  With allowing more and more genetic screening and abortions / manipulations based on genes we are making life more of a commodity.  1.Jim Leffel, Genetic Technology, Engeneering Life: Human Rights in a Postmodern Age,  , accessed 05/23/2011

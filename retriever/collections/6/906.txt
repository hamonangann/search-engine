Europe is not like America and Australia, which were founded by immigrants with considerable homogeneity of language and culture. Canada’s relations with Quebec show that where such differences exist they can be politically destabilising, while federal states such as Brazil and the USSR have not avoided dictatorship, human rights problems and economic backwardness. Within the EU there is often no commonality of interests on key federal issues such as defence and foreign policy. Even today there are big splits on major issues such as agricultural reform and trade policy.  In actuality, Europeans don’t envy Americans because right now EU is far better in every aspect than the US – “Loory: What we have heard today is that the problems here in the U.S. are certainly much worse than in Europe.” [1] ”Anybody who claims that the US provides a model which the EU should copy needs to consider the basic economic facts of the case.” [2]  [1] Loory, ‘Europe's economy doing better than US’  [2] Irvin, ‘Europe vs. USA: Whose Economy Wins?’

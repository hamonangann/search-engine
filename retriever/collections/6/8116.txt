The cities are a source of revenue for Spain  Ceuta and Melilla are economic assets to Spain; it is in Spain’s interest to maintain them. Spain was particularly damaged by the 2008 economic recession which left many of the richest countries in decline1. With no sign of rapid recovery in the near future, it is within Spain’s interests to hold on to two cities which have strong economies2. The ports of Cueta and Melilla are of particular importance as they provided a large portion of the cities’ income, catering to many luxurious boats. The low tax zones also encourage a lot of financial activity3. Spain’s economic position therefore dictates that they should not cede them.  1) Cala,A. ‘Why is Morocco Picking a Fight with Spain?’ 15 August 2010  2) Sotogrande, ‘Ceuta and Melilla’, data accessed 20 January 2014  Ibid

This might be a valid argument if the leaked military secrets really were putting lives in danger, but this is not the case in this particular instance. In Israel there is a military censor which newspapers submit articles that might affect national security to and that censor takes out anything it believes to be harmful to state security. [1] All the materials that were published by Haaretz went first through Haaretz’s editors and then this military censor [2] so if there really were any military secrets published that could have put lives in danger the censors were negligent in their job.

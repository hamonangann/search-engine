Homosexuality has been illegal in Uganda since colonialism. It was signed into law and amended in Ugandaâ€™s constitution but did not change after independence. The blame should therefore go to the British not Ugandan government. If it is a violation of human rights then it is a violation that has been occurring for decades. The long term effect has been that Ugandans now are agreed that LGBT people are not a minority but criminals who deserve punishment.

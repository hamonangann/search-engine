Ignorance about sex is the primary cause of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)  The spread of AIDS in the 80s and 90s showed that education and information is more important than ever as exemplified by the slogan in the British 1980’s advertising campaign to prevent AIDS ‘AIDS: Don’t Die of Ignorance’. The campaigns were credited with credited with changing behaviour through warnings on adverts and informing through an information leaflet.

Giving sex education in schools is crucial to the spread of information to each successive generation, and may be supplemented by frank discussion at home.

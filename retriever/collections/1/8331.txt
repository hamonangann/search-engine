Homework makes sure we remember what we have learnt  One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it. If we just learn the method and donâ€™t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.

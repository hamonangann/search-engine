Time is of the essence in a crisis. When confronted with extremists who see a virtue in their own death, extraordinary methods may be required.

Responding to terrorist threats is something that needs to be dealt with in minutes or hours. Unfortunately, it is in the nature of due process and legal procedure that they trials and questioning take place in a framework of days or weeks.

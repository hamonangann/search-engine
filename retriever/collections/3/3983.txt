Workers already have protection from over work. They have the ability to say "no" and they also have the ability to find themselves other, less lengthy employment.  The fact that jobs with long hours exist is proof that people are happy with the situation. A survey of people opting out of the European working time directive shows that 1 in 4 workers opt out of a limit to their working hours.  "The survey also demonstrates that working hours have not substantially changed since the introduction of the new rules because of the large-scale use of the opt-out clause."  Not only that but workers can already claim for work related injuries, stress and maltreatment via the tribunals and courts, so a deterrent already exists for businesses to overwork their employees.  1 Liza Morgan "Little option But To Opt Out under Working hour Rules"

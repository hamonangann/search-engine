The Arts provide huge benefits to society; easily comparable to humanities or theoretical science  It has already been mentioned that there are plenty of degrees where it is unlikely that graduates will ever use the knowledge they acquire, per se, in their later careers. Proposition has failed to give a reason – other than earning power – as to why the creative arts should be singled out on this ground [i] .  However, in terms of the general utility provided to wider society, it would be hard to point to a discipline that out performs the arts.  Every TV drama, theatre production, concert and so on is likely to include at least a smattering of participants who studied the subject. It is in the nature of the arts that its audience massively outnumbers those participating in its production. Beyond that the trickle down affect of knowledge into every area of public life from ideas and concepts initiated by artists is enormous.  However, if Prop’s entire case is that artists should be paid more for the enormous amount of good they do, we are quite happy to concede the point.

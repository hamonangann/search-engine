The evidence as to the amount of pain an animal feels is by no means clear. Many of the studies showing the animals suffer have been criticized for not carrying out the slaughter in the way prescribed by religious law. Moreover, other studies claim that cutting the throat in this way stops blood flow to the brain so rapidly that it has the same effect as a stun.  Despite all the evidence that religious slaughter does cause pain, the opposition to this remains scientifically credible, and so we canâ€™t base a government policy on one or the other.

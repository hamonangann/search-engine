Firstly, the emergence of the African Union (AU) as a peacekeeping force on the continent negates the need for mercenaries. The AU’s has become increasingly involved in peacekeeping since 200316. They are more willing to involve themselves in African affairs than the West, and have deployed the lion’s share of soldiers in peacekeeping operations as in the Central African Republic17.  Secondly, the UN has condemned mercenary use in general and it would seem hypocritical to begin hiring them. The UN’s weaker states have been reluctant to agree to UN mercenaries for fear they could be used against them18. The UN has actively criticised humanitarian mercenaries in the past for their lack of appreciation of conflict dynamics19, making them unlikely to employ dogs of war.  16) Pan,E. ‘African Peacekeeping Operations’ December 2005  17) Felix,B. ‘Militia attack Muslim neighbourhoods in Central African Republic’s Capital’ 2013  18) Avant,D. ‘Mercenaries’ pg.26  19) Chrisafis,A. ‘UN and aid groups criticise “Humanitarian Mercenaries’ 2007

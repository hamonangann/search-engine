The ban fails to distinguish between different kinds of mines  The ban fails to distinguish between different kinds of mines. The Americans have mines that can deactivate themselves and can self-destruct. America only manufactures smart mines, and since 1976 the USA has tested 32,000 mines with a successful self-destruction rate of 99.996 per cent.

Under American deployment, only smart mines are used, and they are used responsibly, being set and removed in a methodical manner.

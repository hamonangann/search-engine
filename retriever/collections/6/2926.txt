Nuclear power has a proven track record in France, Canada and Russia and an increasing role in new energy markets  There are already stable markets for nuclear power around the world with plants providing a consistent share of energy to the consumer.

There are, however established models of how nuclear power can be blended into an integrated energy supply system.

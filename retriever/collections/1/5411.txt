Any money spent on children is well used. Is there a better way to invest money than to use them to support future generations? The more we spend on childrenâ€™s health care, the more productive our society will be; the more we spend on their education, the wiser our society will be; the more we spend on their cultural awareness, the more conscious of art our society will be. There is no better use of money than spending them on our kids.

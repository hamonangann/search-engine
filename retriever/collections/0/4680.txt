US unilateral intervention is a form of the Western imperialism that has caused so much of the strife that exists in the modern world. There are alternatives â€“while some may contend they will be worse we do not know that this is the case. The United States would remain dominant but it would not need to use its military power in the overbearing way that it does now but rather in a much more constructive way that relies on diplomacy rather than military force. (See proposition argument)

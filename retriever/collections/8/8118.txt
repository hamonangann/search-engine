The citizens do not want to be ceded  Many of those living in Ceuta and Melilla do not want to join Morocco, to cede them would be unjust. Walzer, in his book Just and Unjust Wars, claims that the only people who should decide who has sovereignty over a territory are the population of said land1. If the people associate themselves with Spain, then it is only right that Spain continues to rule over them. This is the case with Ceuta and Mellia, where there is a nearly universal feeling of belonging to Spain2. Morocco and Spain should therefore respect the wishes of the population.  1) Walzer,M. ‘Just and Unjust wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations'  2) Govan,F. ‘The battle over Ceuta, Spain’s African Gibraltar’

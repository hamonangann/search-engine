Renewables are mostly unproven, experimental technologies being developed on a small-scale basis that is not ready to take up the gap to move away from fossil fuels under climate change agreements  The renewable sector is a rapidly changing market moving in between micro-renewables and massive offshore projects. It is a fascinating area as an emergent technology field but it lacks stability both in terms of technology and investment.  Realistically nuclear power is going to have to play an important role in bridging the gap – at the very least – on the road away from a carbon dependent economy [i] .  The technology and funding is simply not in place for any renewable technology to take up the hard lifting from oil and coal yet.  [i] G Paschal Zachary. “The Case for Nuclear Power”.

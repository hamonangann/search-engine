Stifling progress and the right of others  The particular subjects areas often chosen by theists to find offensive make for an interesting list;  Freedom of expression,  The rule of law,  Scientific progress,  Medical progress,  Artistic expression  To name but a few. There are remarkably few areas of human progress and development – intellectual or societal – that have not caused ‘offence’ in some religious community somewhere.

There is no need to seek out obscure fanatics for this purpose, mainstream religious figures seem to genuinely believe that the equality of women is still a difficult issue. To take just one example, in 2012 the supposedly moderate and progressive Anglican Communion is still unsure as to whether the ability to be a senior manager should be determined on the basis of somebody’s gender [i] .

Most religions haven’t even started the process. Now that’s offensive.  [i] BBC Website. Trevor Timpson. Women bishops: Anglicans still unsure over new wording. 17 September 2012.

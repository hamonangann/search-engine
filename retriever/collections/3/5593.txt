The ICC lacks the power to ensure arrests  While the ICC has the power to issue arrest warrants, it does not have the coercive powers to ensure that those warrants are followed. Despite the fact that States that are parties to the Rome Statute are obliged to co-operate with the directions of the Court, there have been many instances where such States have failed to pursue those indicted. Cases that have been referred to the ICC by the United Nations Security Council allows the Court to extend its jurisdiction to include UN member States that are not parties to the Rome Statute. This enabled the ICC to issue an international warrant for the arrest of Sudanâ€™s President Al-Bashir. Yet several of these countries obliged to arrest him have refused when the opportunities have arisen. [1]  [1] Rothe &amp; Collins, pp.198-9

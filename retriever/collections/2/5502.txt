Ignoring the law some of the time undermines the state. The opposition believe that this legislation goes much further than showing solidarity between the government and religion, and is actually the government showing submission to religion. This legislation sets religion as a higher authority than the government and, as such, undermines the governmentâ€™s power as the ultimate authority.  The likely effect is that religious groups will begin to see themselves as above the law and will begin to disregard to government to an ever greater extent.

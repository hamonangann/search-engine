Food labeling does not change consumer behavior  Food labels may include useful dietary information, but they will not significantly impact actual consumption for two reasons.  The first is that people don’t really read or use the labels. A study at WSU shows that only 41% of men actually read the labels. The women did better, but still only 59% of them actually read the labels – which does not mean they actually understood or heeded the advice on them. [1]  The second reason concerns the connection between actually getting the information and acting on it. Research on posting calories on restaurant menus shows that customers actually ordered slightly more calories compared to before the information was made available. [2]  Thus we see that food labels are not enough to nudge customers towards better and healthier food choices.

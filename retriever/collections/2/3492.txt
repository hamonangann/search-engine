National security should come before freedom of information  The Security of the Nation comes before other considerations such as the freedom of information. This is especially true in a nation such as Israel which is surrounded by enemies who will take advantage of any information that they can use to damage Israel. Israel’s security situation is aptly described by Yitzhak Rabin as one of “dormant war” that every few years becomes an active conflict. [1] When the state’s survival is potentially at stake as is the case in Israel then individual rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of information have to be subordinated to the greater collective rights of the nation.

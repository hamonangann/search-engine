It seems unlikely that total publication would save much in the way of time or money. If the data was not indexed in some way it would be absurdly difficult to navigate - and that takes time and money.  There are advantages to building a delay into systems such as this, if a piece of information genuinely justifies a news story, then it will do so at any time. If itâ€™s only of interest in the middle of a media feeding frenzy, then it seems unlikely that it was all that important.

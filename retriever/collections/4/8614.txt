Mobile phones enable us to keep in touch  Mobile communication is very useful and its main use is not to keep us safe but to make life easier. It is clearly useful that we can phone to ask to be picked up rather than always having to set a meeting time in advance. It is equally useful that a mobile phone can tell us if it is likely to rain, or if the train is late. We donâ€™t need this information, but it certainly is helpful, and it is just as helpful for children as for adults.

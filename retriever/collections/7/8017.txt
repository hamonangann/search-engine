Eritrea has been responsible for the majority of this animosity. The country was responsible for aggressively attacking Yemen in 1996. In 2008, Eritrea attacked along the Djibouti-Eritrean border claiming the territory was rightfully theirs1. A theme emerges from these examples, confirmed by President Afewerki of Eritrea when he openly stated he has sought the removal of neighbouring regimes2. The excuse of adopting a siege mentality has also enabled the president to increase his powers and suppress internal dissent3. It is therefore more likely that the government, rather than external players, have contributed to Eritrea’s siege mentality.  1) Mesfin,B. ‘The Eritrea-Djibouti border dispute’, 15 September 2008  2) Eshetu,S. ‘Eritrean Leadership’s “Bunker Mentality”’, 3 September 1998  3) Blair,D. ‘Eritrea: the African North Korea which thousands will risk anything to escape’, 3 October 2013

Many things that can be dangerous are legal, from drugs such as alcohol, to activities such as skydiving, or even rugby. However, millions of people are able to drink or play sports without harming themselves or society. It would seem draconian and extremely paternalistic for the government to ban everything that has the potential to be dangerous; instead, they should educate people about the dangers, but trust them to make decisions about their own lives.  The State has no authority to force its own morality on the general populace unless these drugs can be proven to harm others. The State is the facilitator of the votersâ€™ desires in a democracy. So, a State enforced, morality goes against the obligations of the State to its people.

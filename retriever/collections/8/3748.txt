Denying individuals rights to the city commons.  Forced evictions create an exclusive city. The process of evictions means individuals are targeted, and criminalised, particularly the poor.

For example, in the case of Johannesburg, South Africa, informal street traders have been evicted from using open, public space within the city centre. Such spaces are their means of employment, and as Abahlali Base Mjondolo show, the evictions represent a denial of legal and human rights [1] .

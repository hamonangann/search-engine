Environmental damage caused by alternative sectors is far worse. Pollution in the industrial sector has become much more evident since the removal of Ben Ali’s regime. 13,000 tonnes of industrial pollution are released from the Gulf of Gabes every year, causing high rates of infertility, miscarriages and deaths1. This is a common theme amongst Tunisia’s industrial areas and is far more destructive than tourist activities.  1) Addala,R. &amp; McNeil, ‘Pollution in Gabes, Tunisia’s shore of death’, Al-Jazeera, 14 June 2013

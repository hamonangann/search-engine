One way to deal with this argument is by noting that this would be one tool in a schoolâ€™s arsenal. If it proves to be obviously counterproductive, then it will not be employed, in the same way that other disciplinary tactics schools/society can impose will not be used if they are seen to be adverse or ineffective.

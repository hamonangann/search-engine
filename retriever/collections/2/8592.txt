Theft is an assumption of property rights  Theft is taking something from someone who is the rightful owner without their permission. It doesnâ€™t matter if the rightful owner keeps an original version or not. If you are downloading music from an unofficial source, you are stealing it: you can start listening to that song, without the permission of the original owner. The only way you can get the right to listen to that song is via a legal transaction from which the rights owner can make a profit

The fence only seems to solve the problem and detracts from dialogue about real solutions.  The fence serves as a band-aid fix, seemingly solving the problem while not really advancing comprehensive immigration reform.

This enables us to ignore the need to investigate shady business practices by employers, for instance.  1 Emmott, Robin. "A costly U.S.-Mexico border wall, in both dollars and deaths."

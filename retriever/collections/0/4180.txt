Militarisation of US policy in Africa  The broadening of USAID to accommodate counter-terrorism assistance has detracted from long term development goals. When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced the change of USAID’s focus, the agency transformed from one of development to one of a ‘quasi-security’ nature [1] . Since 2001, USAID has been forced go beyond its traditional humanitarian role. Development goals, which are crucial dealing with the root causes of terrorism such as poverty and poor state-citizen relationships [2] , are being sacrificed for short term military objectives. The military training of police has actually served to detract from development, as police financially exploit citizens with their newly gained power [3] . Africa’s urgent need for development suggests that the expansion of USAID’s role is disadvantageous for the continent.  [1] Hills,A., ‘Trojan Horses?

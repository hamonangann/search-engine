This is not exactly a ban on the sale of fast food to children. This ban does not affect the options of bad foods that parents can continue to feed to their young children if they choose to do so. They will even be able to continue buying happy meals â€“ simply without the toy. It merely alters the incentives slightly toward promoting better, healthier choices by making fast food less appealing.

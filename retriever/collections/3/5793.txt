Bullys are frequently as disturbed and victimised as those they target  According to studies, bullies are often children who are plagued by their own problems: a troubled family situation, feeling of inadequacy, depression, or pressure to fit in [1] .

Putting them through the harrowing experience of a criminal trial, and potentially throwing them in prison will further damage them. Destroying one young life as retribution for another is a model of justice that should find no place in a compassionate society.  [1] Carroll, Linda. ”Kids with ADHD may be more likely to bully”.

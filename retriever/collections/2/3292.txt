In order for this proposal to be taken into consideration, a problem regarding the world of sports must be identified.  Fortunately for sports, it works like a charm. In a great many sports revenues are going up, television rights are being sold for higher prices than ever before and more and more children are enrolling in sporting activities.

Moreover, if we were to introduce this coercive measure, there would be numerous disadvantages without significant benefits. It would make no sense to create purposeless tensions between individuals and sporting federations. It is even more absurd considering that competitions and sporting events wouldn't benefit at all.

Therefore, it would create no advantages regarding the level of the game or increase the spectacle.

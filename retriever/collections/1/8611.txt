Internet anonymity allows internet users to engage in illegal activities  The internet is being used for illegal activities. Examples of these are trading and trafficking in child pornography, drug trading and planning and coordinating terrorist activities. [1] Anonymity makes it easier for these criminals as they can engage in their activities with less fear of being caught.

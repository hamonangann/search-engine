The Church does not have enough of an involvement in UK politics for the objectives of the Church of England to have any impact upon how the country is run. The UK government is still run in an entirely democratic way. While the Church is consulted in certain decisions and bishop have seats in the House of Lords, final decisions are still taken democratically by the government.  There is in no way enough involvement by the church in the state for it to actually undermine the role of the state. [1]  [1] Gay, Kathlyn. “Church and State.” Millbrook Press. 1992.

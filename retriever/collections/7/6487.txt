The Dalai Lama is the only solution for Tibet. His political advocacy as a leader and religious figure is imperative for the problem of Tibet. His commitment for non-violence and cohabitation and cooperation serves the peaceful interests of Tibet while accommodating for moderate changes. His 'Middle Way' platform is the bridge between China Tibet and world-wide international consensus on the Tibetans' right to self-determination. If resistance to China becomes more violent, as it did in 2008, then the Dalai Lama’s third way will become much more relevant as a solution that both sides can potentially sign up to. It may become the only way forward towards a compromise.  Irrespective of some discontent, the Dalai Lama still enjoys the loyalty and respect of most Tibetans.

[2] He remains the undisputed moral leader of Tibetan people, and as such his 'Middle Way' path still has weight.  [1] The Economist. “A colonial uprising”. The Economist. 19 March 2008.

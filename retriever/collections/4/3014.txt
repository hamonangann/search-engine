There are many in Africa who believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice and view the act as unnatural. Religious groups in particular oppose male homosexuality due to sodomy being viewed a sin [1] . If a certain act is viewed as a sin, and it is optional, then it is only logical that this activity should be prohibited under law. In a sense, it is moral to have laws restricting homosexuality in place via this logic. [2] The U.S. and other Western states should not condemn African states and reduce aid for legislating in a way they consider moral.  [1] Islam and Africa ‘Islam and Homosexuality’  [2] Should donors rethink aid to states that persecute gay people? Ware,G. 25/01/12

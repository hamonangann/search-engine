The public already has an effective veto on legislation, and retains the ultimate power over a politicianâ€™s career through its vote at general elections. When governments break their promises, or govern contrary to the preferences of their voters, they are punished by being ejected from office at the subsequent election. This is already an effective way to ensure that public opinion is never ignored for long.

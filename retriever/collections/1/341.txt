When leaders choose to serve the country they should be ready to sacrifice their privacy for the country. There is clearly a different standard for those who are in government and should be publicly accountable to those who are not.

The people have the right to demand their leader has his full attention of the issues affecting the nation. If he can't do that then he should resign.

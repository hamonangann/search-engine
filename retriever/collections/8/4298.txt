There is no reason to believe that African opinions are disregarded when in the UNSC. Three out of 15 members is not particular disproportionate.  First of all, many decisions are taken in the United Nations General Assembly, a completely democratic body, in which the African Union due to its 54 members has a lot of influence. Therefore Africa is not underrepresented on economic and development issues.  Moreover the UNSC is usually following local concerns; the African Union has a chance to intervene on African security issues first like every other regional organisation. Indeed the AU is increasingly providing peacekeeping and even intervention as in Somalia. [1]  [1] African Union Peace and Security, ‘Somalia (Forward AMISON HQ)’, African Union, 12 September 2012,

The reason athletes don’t report the abuses is because they don’t think the abuse is worse than losing their place on the team. This policy changes that by sending a strong message out. Athletes will attach the gravity of the punishment to the crime and might finally begin to understand that this kind of treatment is utterly unacceptable.  It’s also fairly easy to get around the worry of being blamed for the repercussions by having anonymous tip-offs or witness protection.  The IAAF can compensate for lack of earnings too, but ultimately actually this potential makes abuse less likely to happen. If everyone knows what a risk using harsh methods is, then that’s a good thing. Athletes will be less likely to take it and allow it to continue, and coaches won’t want to risk using them.  Currently it’s worth everyone’s while to shut up and let abuse continue, these changes would mean the risk is too high to let that happen.

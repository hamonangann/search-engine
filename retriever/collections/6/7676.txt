Now Damaging Gender Roles?  There is certainly a case to be made that women, in modern-western society have completely shattered the traditional values and roles that are best suited to them.  For example, it has always been the case that men have been the providers, the defenders of themselves, the household and the family. Women have been the maintainers of these things. These things are not unfair. They are not unequal. They are simply what each gender is best suited for.  Women should not feel lesser than men simply because they are "supposed" to do "motherly things". The feminist movement has gone beyond its cause in beginning to deem what role in life is more appropriate.

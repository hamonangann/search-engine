An ongoing humanitarian crisis  Although gradually improving the humanitarian situation in the DRC remains critical. Congo is lacking hospitals, access to safe water and adequate sanitary facilities. Life expectancy remains low at the age of 50.6 for women and 47.3 for men, and child mortality is 109.5 per 1000 births [1] . The country is constantly facing different epidemics; measles and even plague, [2] with HIV/AIDS a major threat.

Even when this does occur DRC will still be one of the poorest countries in the world with little infrastructure.

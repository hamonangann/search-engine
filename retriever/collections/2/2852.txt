Culling badgers is inhumane  The culling of badgers will not be done in a humane way. The intention is that badgers will be shot by trained marksmen but according to the RSPCA “Their anatomy makes it difficult to shoot a free-roaming badger” the result is likely to be large numbers of injured badgers with many escaping “suffer agonizing deaths underground.” [1] As badgers are sentient beings we should be seeking to avoid causing them harm and suffering.

The electoral college allows small third parties to tip the balance in a state and distort the preferences of the voters.

Nevertheless, Gore was the preferred choice of voters in a match up with George W. Bush. [1]  [1] Archives.gov, ‘Historical Election Results’, ‘Electoral College Box Scores 1789-1996’,

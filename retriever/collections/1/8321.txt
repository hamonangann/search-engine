Homework takes up class time  Homework does not only take up time doing the homework at home but also takes up time in class. First there is the time that the teacher takes when explaining the task. Then more time is taken going through the homework when it is done and marked. This time could be better spent engaging with the class to find out what they do and donâ€™t understand. The answer to this is to have more time in class rather than boring homework.

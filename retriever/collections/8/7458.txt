Religion is not a political party, changing and catering to the views of the current electorate. The Church acts as the curator of Godâ€™s Word and maintains its principles no matter how unfashionable they may be. This is especially important in an increasingly secular age when Christianity will only survive by virtue of it maintaining a clear, consistent message.

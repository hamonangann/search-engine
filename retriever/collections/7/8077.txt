The West has demonstrated that hiding behind China is a viable strategy  Perhaps as damaging as the humanitarian consequences of the failure to intervene is the message it sent to other leaders considering solving their political and ethnic problems in a similar manner to Khartoum.  Rather than deterring them from following in Bashirâ€™s footsteps, the West by doing nothing, gave the impression that Bashir survived not through his own efforts, but because China protected him.  Given the rapid expansion of Chinese influence around in Africa, this makes accepting Chinese investment instead of western investment vastly more attractive because in addition to the economic benefits, it is now perceived as buying Chinese political cover.  In turn, this increasing interest in seeking out Chinese political cover will lead to more states being willing to imitate Bashir in the future, safe the knowledge that they will not be bombed.

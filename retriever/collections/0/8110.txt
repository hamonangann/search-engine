Spain claims that there is a difference between Gibraltar and its own territories. While Gibraltar is an overseas territory, otherwise known as a colony, Ceuta and Melilla are part of Spain and maintain the same semi-autonomous status which other regions in Spain have1. The United Nations maintains a similar view, recognising Gibraltar as an ‘overseas territory’ which is reviewed annually by the Committee on Decolonisation2.  1) Govan,F. ‘The battle over Ceuta, Spain’s African Gibraltar’ 10 August 2013  2) United Nations General Assembly, ‘2231 (XXI) Question of Gibraltar’, 20 December 1966

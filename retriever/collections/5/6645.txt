Imposing a ban on earmarking will destabilise congrerss  There is very little chance of Congress ever being willing to give up on having earmarks for their constituency’s. If the ban is voluntary many will not comply and if the ban is mandatory it will need congress to agree to it in the first place. Even those who voice opposition to earmarks make use of the system so it would never pass. [1]  [1] Elander, Eugene, ‘So, what’s wrong with earmarks?’, 2009

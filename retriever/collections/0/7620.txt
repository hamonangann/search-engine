This will foster further resentment of the Hispanic community in America.  This policy will only further the resentment that exists for illegal immigrants in America, and will make life harder for the entire Hispanic community as a result.  It is no secret that the idea of granting illegal immigrants driver’s licenses is a very unpopular idea. In New York, for example, 70% of the electorate is against this policy [1] . Looking to California, not only are drivers licenses out of the question, but in 1994 the state passed a bill denying illegals access to welfare, healthcare and education by a 59% margin [2] . Resentment for the community is high and it is undeniable that this policy will be wildly unpopular with the vast majority of Americans.  The issue with Americans being unhappy with this policy is that they will channel their unhappiness toward all immigrant communities and the Hispanic community more generally. The concept of driver’s licenses especially fuels this hatred because Americans believe that this will allow them to “masquerade” as normal Americans and therefore will assume all Hispanics are these illegals that are masquerading as legal immigrants in their communities. This will only engender more hate and discrimination against these communities.  Therefore, this will seriously harm the Hispanic-American community by fuelling hatred against them in the American majority.  [1] "Immigration: Let them drive." Economist 25 Oct 2007, n. pag.

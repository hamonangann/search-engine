Newspapers offer a better reading experience than digital alternatives  The experience of reading from a newspaper is a far better user experience than reading from a screen, reading from a screen for long periods of time is not only bad for the eyes but quite often becomes uncomfortable. A newspaper however requires natural light to be read and therefore is not as harsh on the eyes. It could also be suggested that people actually prefer the tactile physical experience of a newspaper or book over holding an electronic device, a poll taken on the Guardian 1 website found that 76.1% preferred books, i.e, a physical experience, over a digital one.  Video and audio-based advertisements placed online around the text can also disrupt the reading process, a problem, which does not afflict newspapers.  1 Guardian (2008) E-books or Real Books?

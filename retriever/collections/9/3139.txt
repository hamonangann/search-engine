Food labeling allows companies to deceive consumers  What we have seen with introducing visually impressive food labels is that companies started adopting similar visual elements to promote their products in a dishonest way.  Let’s take for instance Dannon’s Activia, which was marketed as health food (with very convincing packaging that went with that strategy). The labels claimed that the product helped improve digestion by hastening it. Yet the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) found this claim to be false.  On a similar note, Kellogg’s Rice Krispies featured packaging purporting that the product boosted immunity. Again, the regulator found this untrue. [1]  We see that the companies, so in essence telling consumers to trust information on the packaging, can easily misuse labeling.

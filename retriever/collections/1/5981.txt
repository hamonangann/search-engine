The problem of service and enforcement of ASBOs is identical that of all other court orders and can be solved the same way â€“ in the proposition example the obvious solution would be to ensure that the youth in question had had the order fully explained to him on service.  An ASBO can only be made after a court hearing where both sides have the opportunity to have their say. The burden of proof remains on the person seeking the order to show why it is necessary. An impartial magistrate oversees the hearing. People subject to ASBOs are typically allowed to breach it several times before serious enforcement action is taken against them.  The fact is that the system of ASBOs is perfectly just and a much more liberal alternative to simply criminalising minor anti-social behaviour altogether

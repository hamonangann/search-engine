Modern palliative care is immensely flexible and effective, and helps to preserve quality of life as far as is possible. There is no need for terminally ill patients ever to be in pain, even at the very end of the course of their illness. It is always wrong to give up on life. The future which lies ahead for the terminally ill is of course terrifying, but societyâ€™s role is to help them live their lives as well as they can. This can take place through counselling, helping patients to come to terms with their condition.

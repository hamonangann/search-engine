People have a right to choose their cultural values  Society has a right to choose and structure its values as it sees fit and there is no reason why the Western construction of values is right or should take priority over any other.  In Muslim countries faith may be a more important aspect of life that it might be in Western countries and it is entirely legitimate that those societies might choose to value protecting the dignity of their faith over absolute freedom of speech.

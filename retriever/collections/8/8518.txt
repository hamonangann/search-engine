The electoral college is an essential bulwark of federalism.  The electoral college emphasizing the role of states, and abolishing it would weaken federalism. This system reinforces the division and sharing of powers between the states and the national government. Without it the national government would have much greater power over the state governments, and the voice of the people would be quieter. The electoral college is essential to preserving the power of individuals through their state.  Additionally, the Electoral College helps reinforce stable institutions that are essential for maintaining a political regime and preserving a free society.

Whatever value the expression of hate speech has can be discussed in classrooms where the ideas can be discussed in their social context rather than promulgated from a platform. Banning hate speech will not transform universities into factories of rote learning or crush a progressive atmosphere. Hate speech isnâ€™t about affirming rights, it is about limiting rights. There is no analogy here to the feminist or gay rights movements.

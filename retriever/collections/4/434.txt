The former Labour government when considering expansion made it clear that environment would be taken into account when considering the construction of a third run-way so there would be environmental restrictions to make sure that this is not an issue.

Building more runways anywhere else would have a similar environmental impact to the expansion plans.  [1] The Labour Party, ‘A future fair for all; The Labour Party Manifesto 2010’. 2010,

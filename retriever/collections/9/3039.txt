There is no reason why, under this model, you could not retain suitable precautions to ensure that this doesnâ€™t happen.  For example, you could continue the obligation for companies to sell the drug at cost (they would, naturally, continue to be incentivised by the huge profits they expect to make when the drug is licensed). Further, you could impose financial sanctions on companies that refused to take appropriate action towards completing testing.

Using central government spending to encourage growth is still a viable development strategy.  Whilst the important role that local markets play in the development process should be recognised, they are not capable of generating widespread economic change.  NGOs serve a different purpose to governments. They construct local infrastructure projects such as schools and wells, in addition to augmenting skills practiced by established communities by providing access to up-to-date tools and tuition that would normally be unaffordable to the citizens of developing states. However, economic growth also requires significant central spending, in order to develop national infrastructure such as roads and universities. Indian well-drilling efficiency has increased by 70% since the nascent Indian national space programme was tasked with using satellite technology to identify water pockets.  The diverse origins, policies and skillsets of NGOs tend to prevent them from collaborating in an effective fashion. Brazilâ€™s hydroelectric power network could only have been constructed by a single, coherent organisation. A national education policy could not be formulated by NGOs. To reduce government aid would be to remove the backbone of central spending needed for national development.

It is morally wrong to bring children to this cruel and miserable world.  Four out of every five children will be born to families whose members survive on less than $10 a day.

And such an extreme plight of the child is only the beginning. Even if a child is born into a relatively well-off family, there are endless devastating situations he has to face during his life: war, death of family members, chronic illness, divorce, crime, and social exclusion. The list can go on and on forever. Having children is the equivalent of forcing innocent people, against their will, to experience the misery of life. Thus, it is inhumane.  *Shah 2010,

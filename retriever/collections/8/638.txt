While the sector does provide employment, there is a regional and gender disparity. The number of women employed by the generally female friendly industry is below the national average. Only 22.5% of those employed in tourism are female, while the national average is 25.6%1, demonstrating a clear under-representation. Regional disparity also exists between coastal and inland regions. Years of coastal-focused economic growth has resulted in an underdeveloped interior region with few jobs in the tourism sector2.  1) Kärkkäinen,O. ‘Women and work in Tunisia’, European Training Foundation, November 2010  2) Joyce,R. ‘The Regional Inequality Behind Tunisia’s Revolution’, Atlantic Council, 17 December 2013

The events of late 2008 had a variety of complex causes. To try and blame them on one thing alone is not to understand the problem.  What is clear however is that an active financial sector creates jobs and wealth for the American people providing them with the security of a job, a pension and a home in a way that government can only dream of.  There is also no doubt that light regulation allows business to grow and create jobs, the only way out of recession is to allow business to do what it does best; grow America for all our futures.  As Ronald Reagan put it “Government is not the solution to our problems. Government is the problem”.

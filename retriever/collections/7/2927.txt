There is no instance in which renewable energy has been able to provide a major share in the energy market  Despite the best intentions of major players in the energy market, renewable fuels have simply not been able to keep up with demand.

It has proved to be cleaner than any form of fossil fuels. With technological advances it is the obvious fuel of the future and, as a result deserves further funding and research.

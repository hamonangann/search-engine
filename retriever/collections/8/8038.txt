Sanctions are illegal  Sanctions on Cuba are illegal and damage America’s International standing. They violate the UN Charter, laws on the freedom of navigation, and repeated United Nations resolutions since 1992 (passed with only the US and Israel in opposition).

America could achieve its goals internationally more easily if it was not marked with evidence of its lack of respect for International Law.

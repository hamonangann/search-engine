The suggestion that seven million dollars is an excessive expenditure on a resource for 836,000 is extortionate is simply nonsense. Thatâ€™s a little over eight dollars a head, hardly likely to break the bank. To say that a government is not discouraging the use of something by making it harder to access is simply untrue. Of course if a resource is harder or more expensive to access, people will be discouraged from using it.

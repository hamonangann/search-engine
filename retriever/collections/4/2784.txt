While countries like Australia are going to be hit by Climate Change they at least have the resources to carry out adaptation on their own. Poor countries donâ€™t have the money so there will not be any adaptation. The result will be more natural disasters and deaths through disease both things that are seen as worthy of providing aid. I would be much better to help prevent these disasters being too severe than waiting until they occur to provide aid.

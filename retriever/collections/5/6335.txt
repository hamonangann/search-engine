While great poetry may deal with adult experiences there is poetry that targets a younger audience and methods available to teach this type of poetry. Childrenâ€™s poetry, for instance, is not complex or dark in subject matter and uses very regular rhythm and rhyme schemes, which young students will enjoy. If age-appropriate poetry is taught in schools then it gives young people the chance to develop an appreciation for poetry and its various techniques. This means that in later years young people will have the skills necessary to properly understand great poetry.

Corn is only one product in a complex trade system.

Automobile production has shifted away from the US and towards Mexico after NAFTA2. Each country cannot expect to export more of every product- what Mexico has lost in corn production, it has gained in other areas.  1Amy Clark, "Is NAFTA good for Mexico's Farmers?," CBS, February 11, 2009.  2 Scott, Robert, Carlos Salas, and Bruce Campbell.

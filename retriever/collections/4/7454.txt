Sexuality is an intrinsic part of personality  Sexuality is an indivisible part of personhood; people need to be able to express their sexuality openly in order to fully actualise themselves. It is wrong therefore to use sexuality as an individual metric by which they are eligible to become priests or not â€“ they should be taken on the whole of their personhood.

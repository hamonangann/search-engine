The US is not focusing on encouraging existing NATO members to withdraw from the ICC. Existing NATO members are not subject to the aid-cutting provisions of US law (before and after the Presidential waiver was created), neither are major non-NATO allies â€“ indeed, all EU member states in NATO are ICC members, with the exception of Romania none have signed an Article 98 agreement.  Much of the US antagonism to the ICC came during the Bush administration, when the ICC was an unproven organization in its infancy.  Since then, US Policy towards the ICC has softened, as can be evidenced by the US voting in favour of referring the situation in Libya to the ICC (compared to abstaining in the referral of Darfur), so it would be unlikely to do much harm to bilateral relations if other states were to expand their co-operation. No EU member state other than Romania has entered in to an Article 98 Agreement with the US. [1]  [1] Barbour, The International Criminal Court, 2010

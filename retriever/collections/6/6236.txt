The skills learnt within video games are skills that could be learnt elsewhere without the negative problems that have been associated with video games.  All of the benefits listed are thusly moot in this context because things such as team sports are able to develop many of the skills team shooters do, whilst also improving fitness and other areas of well-being. More tactical sports can have a great impact on somebodyâ€™s intellectual well-being as well as their physical well-being.  Additionally, videogames in general might be able to improve some skills, but we are discussing violent videogames in particular. There are other, much less violent, videogames that allow people to further increase their skills.

The Republican Party has been hijacked by the Tea Partiers who simply donâ€™t have a coherent message or ideology  The Tea Party movement has hijacked the Republican Party, bullying elected representatives to pursue a very narrow political agenda that has more to do with their moral outlook than the traditional role of politics. The Tea Party has little in the way of a political programme and nothing in the way of understanding the nuances of local politics or the realities of electoral politics.  While the party remains in thrall to this vociferous but unrepresentative minority, it has little to offer the wider party and les to offer the wider American public.  Although they are strident in terms of what they are against, they have little to offer by way of a substantive contribution to the national debate.
